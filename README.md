## Overview
**Churn Analysis** is a project designed to identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) a business. By analyzing customer data, visualizing key patterns, and optionally building predictive models, companies can take proactive steps to improve customer retention and business growth.

## Features
- âœ… Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- âœ… Data Visualization of key metrics (age, tenure, churn rate, etc.)  
- âœ… Identification of churn patterns  
- âœ… Optional Machine Learning Model for churn prediction  

---

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing customer information, including:  
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Location  
- **Account Details:** Tenure, Subscription Type, Usage Patterns  
- **Churn Status:** Whether the customer left the service  

> **Note:** Update the dataset path in the notebook before running.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**  
- Required Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn` (for ML model)

Install dependencies with:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone <repository_link>
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
```bash
cd churn_analyse
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook churn_analysis.ipynb
```
4. Explore visualizations, insights, and predictions.

## Insights
- Visualizations reveal patterns of churn across customer demographics and account types.  
- Correlation analysis identifies key factors driving churn.  
- Machine Learning models can predict potential churners, enabling strategies to improve retention.
